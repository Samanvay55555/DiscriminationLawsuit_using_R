R PROJECT: A DISCRIMINATION LAWSUIT

A few years ago, a discrimination lawsuit was filed against the California Department of Development
Service (DDS). The California DDS provides funding for developmentally disabled individuals within the
state. The lawsuit claimed that White Non-Hispanic were receiving more funding than Hispanics. If this
was true, the DDS would face some serious legal and financial ramifications, so they hire you as a
statistician to analyze the data behind the issue. The data (California_DDS_Expenditures.csv) can be
found in the Project Module in your course canvas. The DDS is interested in your answers to the
following questions, which should be submitted in the form of a report. Description of the format of the
report can also be found in the same Project Module.

1. Create side-by-side boxplots of the Expenditures by Ethnicity (Native American, Asian, etc).
Describe the plots. Is the lawsuit legitimate? What’s your conclusion?

2. Now subset the data by Age Group (0 to 5 years old, 6 to 12 years old, 13 to 17 years old, 18 to
21 years old, 22 to 50 years old and 51+ years old). Then create side-by-side boxplots of the
Expenditures by Ethnicity for each of the Age Groups. Describe the new plots. What’s your
conclusion?

3. In order to anticipate a future lawsuit about Gender discrimination, now subset your data by
Gender (Female and Male).

a. Construct bar charts using Age Group (defined above) as classes (categories) for the
Expenditures for each Gender. Describe each bar chart and compare the bar charts of the two
gender groups. Does it appear to be discrimination based on Gender?

b. Now create bar charts using Ethnicity as classes for each gender. What is your findings?
